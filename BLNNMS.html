He tried to save his teammates and finally he did it but he sacrified his life for his country. The Mukti Bahini saved their life’s due in large part to Nur Mohammad Sheikh’s efforts. 
        Nur Mohammad Sheikh was born on 26th February 1936 in Moheshkhali village at Narail. His father was Mohammad Amanat Sheikh and his mother was Mosammat Jinnatunnesa Khanam. He lost his parents at an early age. An orphan in childhood he had to sell his paternal landed property for his livelihood. He continued his study up to seventh grade at local schools. After that, Nur Mohammad Sheikh joined the local Ansar Force. And then he joined the East Pakistan Rifles (EPR). He was appointed at the Dinajpur sector after completion of training.
        
        Later on 1st July in 1970, he was transferred to Jessore sector. Nur Mohammad Sheikh participated in the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971. In March 1971, he was staying at his village on a vacation. After the night of March 25, when the liberation war started, he joined sector 8 and continued to take part in different battles at Jessore. He was then in charge of a regular petrol force. Due to his good performance, Lance Nayek Nur Mohammad was selected as the captain of the Standing Patrol team at Goalhati. This Standing Patrol team was created to monitor the Pakistani Army. He died on 5th September 1971 in the battle of Goalhati at Jessore.
        
        Battle of Goalhati – Jessore: For strategic importance, the freedom fighters monitor the Pakistani squad. They wanted to capture the Pakistani Army after a few days. But on September 5 in 1971, suddenly the Pakistani Army managed to point out the position of Nur Mohammad's squad and that time Nur Mohammad was patrolling with only 4 fellow soldiers. After managing the point out of the Nur Mohammad squad’s position the Pakistani Army attacked them from three different sides. Nur Mohammad Sheikh wanted to retreat to his base, so he continued to fire towards the Pakistani enemies.
        
        That time, one of his fellow soldier was shot by the bullet and Nur Mohammad started carrying him towards safety. Then Nur Mohammad was also hit by a mortar. Though he was seriously injured, Nur Mohammad decided to continue to provide covering fire for his team. When Nur Mohammad was seriously bleeding, his fellow Shipahi (an official position of Bangladesh Army) Mostafa, urged Nur Mohammad to go with him. Mostafa even forced Nur Mohammad to go with him but Nur Mohammad refused to go but gave his Light Machine Gun to Mostafa so that it would not be captured after his death. He kept a self loaded rifle with him and kept on fighting until he died. He was buried in Jessore.</p>
